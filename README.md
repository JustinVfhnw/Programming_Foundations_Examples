# 📘 Programming Foundations Examples

This repository contains example programs from **Tony Gaddis' book _Starting Out with Python_**. The examples are organized by chapter and demonstrate key programming concepts step by step, making it easier to learn the foundations of Python.

## 📂 Repository Structure

The examples are grouped by chapter, following the structure of the book:

```
Programming_Foundations_Examples/
├── Chapter 02/   # Variables, input, output, basic math
├── Chapter 03/   # Decision structures (if/else)
├── Chapter 04/   # Loops and repetition structures
├── Chapter 05/   # Functions
├── Chapter 06/   # Files and exceptions
├── Chapter 07/   # Lists and tuples
├── Chapter 08/   # More about strings
├── Chapter 09/   # Dictionaries and sets
├── Chapter 10/   # Classes and object-oriented programming
...
```

Each folder contains small, focused `.py` scripts such as:
- `simple_math.py`
- `loan_qualifier.py`
- `for_loop_with_break.py`
- `commission.py`
- `test_score_average.py`

These scripts are designed to be **short and self-contained**, so learners can run and modify them easily.
