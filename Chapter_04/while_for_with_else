# Using while and for with else
# The else block after a while (or for) loop executes only
# if the loop completes normally — that is, it didn’t exit via a break statement.

# while loop
numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
target = 6
i = 0

while i < len(numbers):
    if numbers[i] == target:
        print("Found the number!")
        break
    i += 1
else:
    print("Number not found!")


# for loop
for num in numbers:
    if num == target:
        print("Found the number!")
        break

    print("Number not found.")
